## Curent Features
---
+ Firstly I am proud of syncing the buttons to the games using both the terminal and pop up windows.
+ Secondly I am proud of the formatting, layout, and ways to improve hpow it looks. 
+ Thirdly I am proud of how we made so many gtames and implemented them to be able to run in the terminal and be able to go back to the pop up everytime without any errors.
